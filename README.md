# Visualizations and Insights

## Introduction:
The National Hockey League (NHL) is a premier professional ice hockey league comprising teams from North America.
Understanding player performance and trends is crucial for teams, coaches, and analysts to make informed decisions.
In this project, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook to visualize and analyze NHL player data from the 2023-2023 season.
By exploring various aspects of player performance, we aim to uncover insights and patterns that can provide valuable insights into player dynamics, team strategies, and overall league trends.

## Overview

The dataset includes various statistics and attributes of NHL players from the 2023-2024 season. Below is an explanation some of the columns included in the dataset:

- DRAFTED: Draft information in the format draft number - round - year(team)
- GP: Games Played
- G: Goals
- A: Assists
- P: Points
- +/-: Plus/Minus rating
- Sh: Shots on goal
- Sh%: Shooting percentage
- TOI: Time on ice
- W: Wins (Goalie stats)
- L: Losses (Goalie stats)
- SO: Shutouts (Goalie stats)
- GAA: Goals against average (Goalie stats)
- Sv%: Save percentage (Goalie stats)
- TYPE: Contract type
- SIGNING AGE: Player age when signing the contract
- LENGTH: Contract length

## Objectives

- Visualize the data to identify patterns and trends.
- Provide insights into player performance and contract details.

 I will be creating various visualizations to provide quick insights into the data. Some of the visualizations will include:

- Distribution of player statistics (e.g., age, points, salary)
- Analysis of contract types and lengths
- Trends in drafting patterns and player performance

## Data:
