The National Hockey League (NHL) is a premier professional ice hockey league comprising teams from North America.
Understanding player performance and trends is crucial for teams, coaches, and analysts to make informed decisions.
In this project, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook to visualize and analyze NHL player data from the 2023-2023 season.
By exploring various aspects of player performance, we aim to uncover insights and patterns that can provide valuable insights into player dynamics, team strategies, and overall league trends.
